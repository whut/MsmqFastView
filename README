MSMQFastView is very, very simple MSMQ queues viewer. Its UI is optimized for speed.

It supports subqueues and showing body of arbitrary large messages.

Requirements:
 - Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 (or higher)
 - MSMQ
 - .NET 4.0

Remote connection notes:
 - with both machines in the same domain, no special configuration is needed
 - domain client -> workgroup server:
    * only queue names will be shown, viewing messages will fail (Vista+ OS limitation; MSMQ MMC snap-in has the same problem)
    * requires accounts with matching names and passwords on both computers, the client may use a domain or local account
 - workgroup client -> domain server:
    * viewing messages requires:
       + turning off RPC security (uncheck "Disable un-authenticated RPC calls" in MSMQ properties on the server)
       + for each queue, granting "Receive Message" and/or "Receive Journal Message" to "ANONYMOUS LOGON" pseudo-user (on the other hand, MSMQ MMC snap-in requires only "Peek" permission)
    * requires accounts with matching names and passwords on both computers, must be a local account on the server
 - works for accounts with administrative privileges on the server; not tested with limited accounts
